        <p>Help Save Red Pandas is all about putting an end to illegal, underground red panda fighting. We hope to bring attention to this tragic and horrible activity that has taken hold in China and is spreading through East Asia with alarming rapidity. Our goal is to put an end to the brutal fights, entirely.</p>

        <p>The group responsible for this atrocity is called the Red Panda Fight Club (Hong Xiongmao Zhandou Julebu) and originated in southwestern China. Every year, they are responsible for the mutilation and deaths of almost 300 Red Pandas, which are considered Endangered, via their underground fight tournaments. This makes the Red Panda very sad.</p>
